## Calebh101

I like to make whatever comes to my mind.

## Versioning

Here is my versioning standard:

Layout: major.minor.bug (major.minor.bug.specific)

Example: 1.2.4B

- major (1): Signifies big new release (0 means beta, 1 means release, 2+ means other big releases)

- minor (2): Signifies 

- bug (4): Signifies large bug fixes or small improvements.

- specific (B): Signifies small bug fixes or small improvements.

| Type | Major | Mediocre | Minor | Tiny |

| Features         | Yes | Some | Rarely | No  |
| Visible changes  | Yes | Yes | Maybe | Small to none |
| Improvements     | Maybe | Maybe | Yes | Yes |
| Bug fixes        | Maybe | Maybe | Yes | Yes |
| Example | 1 | 2 | 4 | B |
