ABOUT

C# Beginning Software Developer

To clear things up, my version system is this:
0.1.2A
-First digit (0): If 0, is beta, if 1, is first primary release, if 2+ is major updates
-Second digit (1): Regularly minor releases, but still feature releases
-Third digit (2): Normally either very small feature releases or medium-sized bug fixes
-Letter (A): Small bug fixes //Can be an extra digit instead for apps that don't support letters, if so it will look like 0.0.0.0
//Think of it like iOS updates, like 17.1.1, with RCs being the letters

NOTES
-If you notice that, in a project, the source code and the release don't match, I probably forgot to update one of them. (Fun fact, the entire reason I put version numbers on the source code is for me to keep track)
