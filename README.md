# About

## Calebh101

Self-teaching to be a full-stack software engineer. My current experience:

- Flutter: some experience
- JavaScript (and TypeScript): frontend and Node.js
- Website: HTML and CSS
- A bit of Python knowledge

## Accomplishments

- Created the repository [dexcom](https://github.com/Calebh101/dexcom), an ongoing project to document and create packages for the Dexcom Share API. I have provided full documentation in that repository, including what it is, how it works, and other things. I have also published a package on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) named [dexcom](https://pub.dev/packages/dexcom) that allows easy usage of the Dexcom Share API.

## Versioning

Here is my versioning standard:

Layout: major.minor.bug (major.minor.bug.specific)

Example: 1.2.4B

- major (1): Signifies big new release (0 means beta, 1 means release, 2+ means other big releases)

- minor (2): Signifies 

- bug (4): Signifies large bug fixes or small improvements.

- specific (B): Signifies small bug fixes or small improvements.

| Type | Major | Mediocre | Minor | Tiny |

| Examples | 1 | 2 | 4 | B |
| Features         | Yes | Some | Rarely | No  |
| Visible changes  | Yes | Yes | Maybe | Small to none |
| Improvements     | Maybe | Maybe | Yes | Yes |
