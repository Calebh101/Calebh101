# ABOUT

## Calebh101

Self-teaching to be a software engineer, currently know enough to make decent websites and currently trying to learn Flutter.

## Accomplishments

- Created the repository [dexcom](https://github.com/Calebh101/dexcom), an ongoing project to document and create packages for the Dexcom Share API. I have provided full documentation in that repository, including what it is, how it works, and other things. I have also published a package on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) named dexcom that allows easy usage of the Dexcom Share API.

# NOTES
- If you notice that, in a project, the source code and the release don't match, I probably forgot to update one of them. (Fun fact, the entire reason I put version numbers on the source code is for me to keep track)
