I like to make whatever comes to my mind.

## Versioning

Here is my versioning standard:

Layout: major.minor.bug (major.minor.bug.specific)

Example: 1.2.4B-R2

- major (1): Signifies big new release (0 means beta, 1 means release, 2+ means other big releases)

- minor (2): Signifies a medium-ish release?

- bug (4): Signifies large bug fixes or small improvements.

- specific (B): Signifies small bug fixes or small improvements.

- beta re-release (R2): The number after the R signifies a beta re-release, like when iterating over the same release for a bit. This is normally not present and is used very little.

| Type | Major | Mediocre | Minor | Tiny | Beta re-release
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Features         | Yes | Some | Rarely | No  | Maybe
| Visible changes  | Yes | Yes | Maybe | Small to none | Maybe
| Improvements     | Maybe | Maybe | Yes | Yes | Maybe
| Bug fixes        | Maybe | Maybe | Yes | Yes | Maybe
| Example | 1 | 2 | 4 | B | | R1

## localpkg

localpkg is the name for a group of packages that I can use in several different applications. The current localpkg selection:

- [localpkg for Dart](https://github.com/Calebh101/localpkg-dart): For my Dart apps/projects.
